This is the project directory for team TBD.
The results are easily reproducible with algo_gym.py script. 
Run python algo_gym.py --help for different options. The outputs from 
different algorithms are saved into log.csv. Requirements can be installed
with pip using the requirements.txt file. Beware, some of the algorithms 
have a significant runtime.
